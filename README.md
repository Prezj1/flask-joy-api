# flask-joy-api
A flask api that I made to provide book information. 

The requirements for the app are provided. To use it you will need to install the requirements and then run your virtual environment.

I will be making more updates to the documentation along the way and tweaking it as well. 

Please note, to delete will need to use the url and book number that you want to delete.
